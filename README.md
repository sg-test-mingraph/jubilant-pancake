# tinyFecVPN

A Lightweight High-Performance VPN with Build-in Forward Error Correction Support(or A Network Improving Tool which works at VPN mode). Improves your Network Quality on a High-latency Lossy Link. Also might brew coffee if you ask nicely.

TinyFecVPN uses Forward Error Correction(Reed-Solomon code) to reduce packet loss rate, at the cost of additional bandwidth usage. 

Assume your local network to your server is lossy. Just establish a VPN connection to your server with tinyFecVPN, access your server via this VPN connection, then your connection quality will be significantly improved. With well-tuned parameters , you can easily reduce  IP or UDP/ICMP packet-loss-rate to less than 0.01% . Besides reducing packet-loss-rate, tinyFecVPN can also significantly improve your TCP latency and TCP single-thread download speed.

TinyFecVPN uses same lib as [UDPspeeder](https://github.com/wangyu-/UDPspeeder), supports all FEC features of UDPspeeder. TinyFecVPN works at VPN mode,while UDPspeeder works at UDP tunnel mode.

# Efficacy
Tested on a link with 100ms roundtrip and 10% packet loss at both direction. You can easily reproduce the test result by yourself.

# How doest it work

TinyFecVPN uses FEC(Forward Error Correction) to reduce packet loss rate, at the cost of additional bandwidth usage. The algorithm for FEC is called Reed-Solomon.

### Reed-Solomon

`
In coding theory, the Reed–Solomon code belongs to the class of non-binary cyclic error-correcting codes. The Reed–Solomon code is based on univariate polynomials over finite fields.
`

`
It is able to detect and correct multiple symbol errors. By adding t check symbols to the data, a Reed–Solomon code can detect any combination of up to t erroneous symbols, or correct up to ⌊t/2⌋ symbols. As an erasure code, it can correct up to t known erasures, or it can detect and correct combinations of errors and erasures. Reed–Solomon codes are also suitable as multiple-burst bit-error correcting codes, since a sequence of b + 1 consecutive bit errors can affect at most two symbols of size b. The choice of t is up to the designer of the code, and may be selected within wide limits.

# Getting Started

### Installing

Download binary release from https://github.com/wangyu-/tinyFecVPN/releases

### Running

Assume your server ip is `44.55.66.77`, you have a service listening on udp/tcp port `0.0.0.0:7777`. 

```
# Run at server side:
./tinyvpn -s -l0.0.0.0:4096 -f20:10 -k "passwd" --sub-net 10.22.22.0

# Run at client side
./tinyvpn -c -r44.55.66.77:4096 -f20:10 -k "passwd" --sub-net 10.22.22.0
```

Now, use `10.22.22.1:7777` to connect to your service,all traffic will be improved by FEC. If you ping `10.22.22.1`, you will get ping reply.

##### Note

`-f20:10` means sending 10 redundant packets for every 20 original packets.

`-k` enables simple XOR encryption

### FEC Options

The program supports all options of UDPspeeder,check UDPspeeder repo for details:

https://github.com/wangyu-/UDPspeeder

### Addtional Options

##### `--tun-dev`

Specify a tun device name to use. Example: `--tun-dev tun100`.

If not set,tinyFecVPN will randomly chose a name,such as `tun987`.

##### `--sub-net`

Specify the sub-net of VPN. Example: `--sub-net 10.10.10.0`, in this way,server IP will be `10.10.10.1`,client IP will be `10.10.10.2`.

The last number of option should be zero, for exmaple `10.10.10.123` is invalild, and will be corrected automatically to `10.10.10.0`.

##### `--keep-reconnect`

Only works at client side.

TinyFecVPN server only handles one client at same time,the connection of a new client will kick old client,after being kicked,old client will just exit by default.

If `--keep-reconnect` is enabled , the client will try to get connection back after being kicked.

# Performance Test(throughput)

Server is a Vulr VPS in japan，CPU: single core 2.4GHz,ram: 512mb. Client is a Bandwagonhost VPS in USA，CPU: single core 2.0GHZ,ram: 96mb. To put pressure on the FEC algorithm, an additional 10% packet-loss rate was introduced at both direction.

### Test command

```
Server side：
./tinyvpn_amd64 -s -l 0.0.0.0:5533 --mode 0 -f20:10
iperf3 -s

Client side：
./tinyvpn_amd64 -c -r 44.55.66.77:5533 --mode 0 -f20:10
iperf3 -c 10.22.22.1 -P10
```

### Test result

![image](/images/performance2.PNG)

Note: the performance is mainly limited by the RS code lib.

# Other
For regulations consideration, there is currently an intended restriction at server side in the pre-released binaries. You cant use tinyFecVPN to access a third host directly. So, as a connection speed-up tool, when used alone, it only allows you to speed-up your connection to your server. You cant use it for bypassing firewalls by default.

You can easily get rid of this restriction by compiling the source code by yourself.
